<h1 class=artist>Billie Eilish</h1>
<h1 class=title>Bad Guy</h1>
<h2 class=album>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</h2>
<h2 class=year>2019</h2>

<p class=verse>White shirt now red, my bloody nose<br>
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes<br>
Creeping around like no one knows<br>
Think you're so criminal<br>
Bruises, on both my knees for you<br>
Don't say thank you or please<br>
I do what I want when I'm wanting to<br>
My soul? So cynical</p>

<p class=chorus>So you're a tough guy<br>
Like it really rough guy<br>
Just can't get enough guy<br>
Chest always so puffed guy<br>
I'm that bad type<br>
Make your mama sad type<br>
Make your girlfriend mad tight<br>
Might seduce your dad type<br>
I'm the bad guy, duh</p>

<p class=verse>I'm the bad guy<br><br>

I like it when you take control<br>
Even if you know that you don't<br>
Own me, I'll let you play the role<br>
I'll be your animal<br>
My mommy likes to sing along with me<br>
But she won't sing this song<br>
If she reads all the lyrics<br>
She'll pity the men I know</p>

<p class=chorus>So you're a tough guy<br>
Like it really rough guy<br>
Just can't get enough guy<br>
Chest always so puffed guy<br>
I'm that bad type<br>
Make your mama sad type<br>
Make your girlfriend mad tight<br>
Might seduce your dad type<br>
I'm the bad guy, duh</p>

<p class=verse>I'm the bad guy, duh<br><br>

I'm only good at being bad, bad<br><br>

I like when you get mad<br>
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone<br>
You said she's scared of me?<br>
I mean, I don't see what she sees<br>
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne<br><br>

I'm a bad guy<br>
I'm a bad guy<br>
Bad guy, bad guy<br>
I'm a bad-</p><br>
